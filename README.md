# MarchingCubesTables.h

This is taken from user https://gist.github.com/dwilliamson who had a JavaScript file for the marching cubes tables. I needed it for C++, so there you go.

Converted from JS to C++ from the following gist: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dwilliamson/c041e3454a713e58baf6e4f8e5fffecd/raw/3c761fa2dfc4333749626ed3d1a0ff25d708089c/MarchingCubes.js
